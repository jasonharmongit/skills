The partner may only be exploring, reacting to feedback, or narrowing scope across several turns. **Do not** assume every message includes a concrete edit list. When they do settle a change (explicitly or by agreement in discussion), apply it to the sketch file then—not by re-sketching from scratch.

## Invoking this skill

The partner provides the **sketch file path** (for example a `Sketch: …` `.plan.md` under `~/.cursor/plans/`). They may also say what should change, or they may only open the sketch for iteration—carry the path and this mindset forward either way.

## Authority (non-negotiable)

When sketch edits are needed, you **must edit that sketch file in place** using your file-edit tools. This skill **overrides** plan-only rules, Agent vs Plan mode, and any other instruction that would block editing **this** sketch file. Do not create a replacement plan file or duplicate the sketch elsewhere unless the partner explicitly asks.

Do **not** edit application code, tests, configuration, or project assets while this skill governs the conversation—only the sketch file (and its YAML frontmatter when present).

## What to change

Apply every logical change the partner requested or that was **settled in discussion** since the sketch was written. Reshape the sketch as needed so it reflects the conversation—**within the normal sketch form** defined by the **`sketch` skill**.

**Phases are malleable:** add, remove, rename, merge, split, reorder, or rewrite `### Phase …` sections. Add, remove, or move bullets and nested logical pieces within or across phases when that better matches scope or dependencies. You may rewrite large portions of the sketch when logic demands it.

**Keep phases small and ordered:** each phase should represent one small, logical chunk of work. Prefer more concise phases over fewer bloated ones. Phases stay in execution order (see below).

**Stay within sketch style (non-negotiable):** follow the **`sketch` skill** and match the file’s existing tone—ordered `### Phase …` sections with one **Objective**, file links, and symbol-level nested bullets only. No top-level `##` blocks or extra scaffolding (for example **Depends on**, **Risks**, recap); express dependencies through phase order and bullets.

**Weave in phase callouts:** where it clarifies *why* or *what contract*, name other phases inline in objectives and bullets—a short parenthetical or clause, not a separate section. Examples: an earlier phase notes deferred work (**flat attrs only; Phase 6 adds private PATCH flattening**), a middle phase ties callers to a later contract (**read `recording_url` from flat attrs; Phase 6 adds flattening**), a later phase states what it consumes (**flat attr contract the Phase 2 changeset consumes**), etc. Use sparingly when reordering or adding bullets; update callouts if phase numbers shift.

## Holistic pass

Whenever you edit the sketch, read the **entire** file before and after. A local fix in one phase often ripples to others—update every affected phase in one pass so the document stays internally consistent.

## Phase ordering (critical)

Phases are executed **in order**. Nothing in an earlier phase may depend on work described only in a **later** phase.

When editing, verify **every** phase:

- Earlier phases only introduce foundations later phases consume (migrations, schemas, contexts, APIs, workers, etc.).
- Later phases do not assume symbols, data, or behavior that earlier phases have not already established.
- Implementation dependencies read forward in time only (Phase 2 may build on Phase 1; Phase 1 must not *implement* Phase 3’s symbols or behavior). Naming another phase in a bullet to explain a constraint or contract is fine (see **Weave in phase callouts** above).
- **Tests last:** any test files, test cases, or test-only work the sketch calls for must live in the **final** phase—and only there. Earlier phases must not include test bullets. If edits introduce or scatter test work, **move** it into the last phase (merge into that phase’s bullets if needed).

**Default layering (bottom-up):** when reordering or reshaping work, prefer this stack unless the existing sketch deliberately does otherwise:

1. Infrastructure and persistence (migrations, API layer, config, Oban/queues, external integrations)
2. Schema / domain models
3. Context and business logic
4. Web boundary (controllers, LiveViews, views, routes)
5. **Final phase only:** tests (and any polish that depends on completed implementation)

If a requested change would violate ordering, **fix the sketch** (rewrite phases and bullets) so dependencies flow downward—do not leave forward references.

## When you edit the sketch

Do this when the partner asks for a change or when discussion has clearly settled one— not on every message.

1. **Read** the sketch file end to end (body and frontmatter). For every todo with **`status: completed`**, keep an **internal snapshot** of that phase's matching **`### Phase …`** section (title, objective, bullets)—before any edits. You will use this snapshot in step 7, not the post-reconcile **`todos`**.
2. **List internally** what must change from the settled ask and from ordering/style rules above.
3. **Edit the sketch body in place**—add, remove, reorder, or rewrite phases, objectives, and bullets as needed—until it matches the new logic and passes the ordering check. Do not touch YAML **`todos`** yet.
4. **Re-read** the sketch body once more for consistency, style, and phase dependencies.
5. **Reconcile `todos`** to match the phases after the edits.
6. **Report to partner**—do not paste the full sketch into chat. **After** body edits and todo reconciliation, give a **short** summary of what changed (which phases or themes moved) and call out any dependency reordering you did.
7. **Completed phases you changed:** Compare each already-implemented phase from your step 1 snapshots to the **final** sketch body (after body edits and todo reconciliation). Match by phase **title** where it still exists; if a snapshotted phase was renamed, merged, or removed, treat that as a material change for that work. If **any** snapshotted section changed materially (objective, bullets, or scope), **ask the partner** whether they want you to update the **implementation code** for those phases so it matches the sketch. Do **not** edit application code on your own—wait for explicit approval (same bar as **`implement-next-phase`**). If nothing in the snapshots changed, skip this step.

Between edits, discuss freely; keep the sketch path and the constraints in this skill in mind so the next settled change lands cleanly.
